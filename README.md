# MultiUnitTests

This application is to test having multiple unit testing frameworks in a single ASP.NET MVC application. And to verify that this will work with GitHub Actions.

## .NET

This uses .NET 9

## Special considerations

Since this is a test project, just to prove to myself that it is possible to have multiple unit testing frameworks in a single Visual Studio application, I have not included any authentication. Also, it does not have SSL. This is just for testing some ideas.
